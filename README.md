# Nation Simulator

Hi, welcome to the Nation Simulator. 
The Nation Simulator simulates a nation based on data from NPCs and human players.
This project is NOT a game; It is my attempt at testing out politcal ideas without the messiness of politics.
I would like to see this project be used for governments that are willing to look for solutions to their citizen's problems.

## Contributors

Since I'm not a very good programmer, I could use help.

Much needs implementation such as economy, banking, investing, housing, and UI... UI is a huge pain for some reason.

### Technologies and their use

So far, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are being used. I've included Boostrap, but will be trying to cut it out after I get CSS Grids and Flexbox working. Vue.js will probably take the place of JQuery (maybe).
