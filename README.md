# Nation Simulator

Hi, welcome to the Nation Simulator. 
The Nation Simulator simulates a nation based on data from NPCs and human players.
This project is NOT a game; It is my attempt at testing out politcal ideas without the messiness of politics.
I would like to see this project be used for governments that are willing to look for solutions to their citizen's problems.

## Contributors

Much needs implementation such as economy, banking, investing, housing, and UI... UI is a huge pain for some reason.

### Technologies and their use

So far, HTML, CSS, and Javascript are being used. I've included Boostrap, but will be trying to cut it out after I get CSS Grids and Flexbox working. Vue.js will probably take the place of JQuery (maybe).

### Note: Time

I started to switch this idea over to Unity till I found that dropdowns don't work as well in Unity as they do in JS. Due to my limited time, however, the project will take longer and any contribution is welcomed. Since going to and returning from Egypt, I'm out of a job and trying to build up my skills while searching for a new one. I also have several other projects in the works, thus giving me less time to focus on this project. That being said, I plan to add bits of code here and there in my spare time.
